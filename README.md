=============

oldpintos is the pintos code base that we recieved from the instructor. It should be unchanged and uncompiled. Decided to keep it just in case there is a need to reference what the original code looked like.

pintos is the code base with all of the changes our group has made thus far.

Project 1
  Consist of removing busy waits from putting threads to sleep using the timer_sleep function. And implementing scheduling   in pintos.
  Instructor has given us tests that we can use to check if our changes to pintos works to his specifications.
  For more information on Project 1 check issues.
